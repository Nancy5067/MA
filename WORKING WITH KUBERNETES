Step-1: Add a new instance to your setup, then proceed to create a master node and establish a cluster using the following commands:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnativelabs/kube- router/master/daemonset/kubeadm-kuberouter.yaml
You have the option to generate a worker node by executing the command provided by the master node on a separate instance. 

Basic Commands: 
Execute "kubectl get nodes" to inspect the available nodes in the cluster.
Run "kubectl get pods" to observe the list of running pods.
Utilize "kubectl get services" to examine the available services within the cluster
